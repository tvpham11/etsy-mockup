Make sure your little one is ready with her own version of the Bay by brownie-goose. With the options of a flutter sleeve or not, this sweet sundress screams classic design. But then you see the back, and that sweet, swooping wrap-back almost takes your breath away. Oh my stars - that back. Gets me every time. The Bay combines timeless designs with classic lines and is perfect for days spent in the sun followed by nights of chasing fireflies.\r\n\r\nThis pattern comes with instructions for a dress, top or drop-waist dress and includes a tutorial on a curved AND straight back skirt piece. \r\n\r\nThis e-pattern includes step-by-step instructions with lots of pictures to guide you through the construction of the dress/tunic with a glossary of terms in the back. \r\n\r\nSizes - 18 mo, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 10 and 12.\r\n\r\nFor information on materials needed and a sizing chart for this pattern, please visit this link (http://browniegoose.blogspot.com/search/label/size%20chart%20list) and click the appropriate pattern.\r\n\r\nThis listing is for the pdf pattern, NOT the actual dress/top.\r\n\r\nThis pdf is now available in instant download, yippee!

        "description": "Corning made so many interesting cooking items! This one is a rectangular Green Medallion pattern casserole or brownie pan. This would work to roast veggies, make lasagna, cake, brownies, lemon bars, or anything really. I think this is one of the most versatile sizes they made. \n\nVintage Corning Ware is oven-safe, dishwasher safe, microwave-safe, freezer-safe, and most old pieces can also be used on the stovetop. \n\nNo burns or cracks. It does have wear and scuffing both on the outside and inside and has been used over the years. The rim has some pinhead small black flecks. While not perfect, it&#39;s completely usable.\n\nMeasures 12 x 7.5 x 2 inches\n2 quarts\nP-332\n___________________________________________________________\n\nLooking for more Corning, Pyrex, or other Bakeware?

The shop is in California and shipping is calculated to New York. We refund shipping costs over a couple dollars. We can also re-calculate shipping beforehand if you send your zip code before purchase. \r\n\r\n______________________\r\n-INTERNATIONAL-\r\n______________________\r\n\r\nOVERSEAS SHIPPING: \r\nWe can ship to certain countries, but we will have to recalculate shipping based on your location.

Keep the wrapping, box, and item, and take a photo of it and send the photos to us as proof of damage. We need the photo as proof of damage for insurance claims at the Post Office. \r\n\r\n-Buyer must sign an affidavit for any insurance claims, before any money can be refunded.

Please contact a shop within 7 days of your shipment arrival if you wish to make a return.

        "title": "12 Dark Chocolate Cocoa Doughnuts with Dark Chocolate Peanut (or Almond) Butter Icing ( Low Carb, Sugar Free, Gluten Free, Grain Free)",
        "description": "This is the dark chocolate cocoa doughnuts with dark chocolate and peanut butter icing. You get 12 regular size doughnuts. These are the regular size cake doughnuts.  I eat one of these for breakfast and the protein and good fats make them very filling.  These are big, nice doughnuts.  They have about 5 net carbs each including the icing.\n \nThese are made with almond flour, coconut flour, dark chocolate cocoa powder, organic extra virgin coconut oil, free range organic eggs, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla, erythritol, stevia, and aluminum free baking powder.  The icing has Lindt 85% dark chocolate, natural chunky peanut butter, stevia, erythritol, real butter, and organic extra virgin coconut oil.\n\nThese are low carb, gluten free, grain free, sugar free, and made with natural sweeteners. The coconut oil also gives you a metabolic boost. These are high in protein and good fats and will keep you full for a long time. They are also very diabetic friendly. These taste so good you will never realize you are eating so healthy!\n\nHere is the nutritional info that I have come up for these. They are made by hand instead of a machine so this is not an exact measure, but is based on dividing my recipe by 12:\n\ndougnuts without icing:\n330 calories each\n30 grams of fat - 270 calories from fat\n7 carbs - 28 calories from carbs\n4 grams fiber = 3 net carbs per doughnut\n8 grams protein - 32 calories from protein\n\nicing for each doughnut:  (12 servings)\n\n103.5 calories per serving\n9.5 grams of fat -  85.5 calories from fat\n2.5 carbs - 10 calories from carbs\n1 gram fiber = 1.5 net carb per serving\n2 grams protein - 8 calories from protein\n\n\n\nI will pack the icing separately and you can just melt the icing a bit, spoon the icing over them, refrigerate. and eat.  I will put the directions in the box with them, but it is very simple.  I will pack them iced if you request, but there may be some melting that occurs if I do that.  \n\nThese are made to order and I can substitute items as needed.  If you are allergic to peanuts or do not eat peanuts, I can substitute almond butter or sunflower seed butter for the peanut butter.  All orders are shipped USPS priority.  I highly prefer to ship Monday thru Wednesday so your order does not sit at the post office over the weekend.\n\n\nAllergen Information: Items contain EGGS and NUTS.\n\nBeautiful photography provided by Kaysi Jacks Photography. \nFor information please visit her Facebook page: \nhttp://www.facebook.com/#!/pages/Kaysi-Jacks-Photography/119907081430729",

I also use free range eggs and other natural ingredients.\r\nAll my items are all prepared fresh, made to order, in an industrial kitchen. I have been on a low carb diet for many years and I am much healthier and slimmer as a result. The problem I found was finding good tasting, chemical free desserts. Through trial and error I have come up with many wonderful tasting desserts that match these criteria.\r\n\r\nMy husband and I have adopted two special needs boys from China.

        "description": "Original Vintage Kodak Brownie Bullet Camera – modified into a working premium nightlight.\nRemarkable camera with some signs of years of service.\n\nThis camera nightlight is a great present for the collector of vintage memorabilia and retro artifacts, giving them a chance to display a real vintage camera. \nThe replaceable light bulb at the center is a play on the bright flash that once came out of this camera while it was in its prime.\n\nUse standard incandescent nightlight bulbs (7w or 4w) with a light sensor (will only light up during the night).\nFit in most standard U.S. 120V receptacle.\nCamera is 4&quot; x 3&quot; x 3&quot;\n\nHistory:\n\nType: Solid body eyelevel rollfilm\nIntroduced: Sept 1957\nDiscontinued: 1964\nFilm size: 127\nPicture size: 1 5/8 X 2 1/2&quot;\nManufactured: US, Brazil\nLens: Dakon\nShutter: Rotary\nNumbers made: ?\nOriginal price: promotional\n\nThe Brownie Bullet is a promotional, or &quot;premium&quot;, exact copy of the Brownie Holiday camera. It has a moulded black plastic body with white, cream, or grayish controls. \n\nFun Facts:\nSome Kodak cameras, like the Brownie Bullet, were described as &quot;premium&quot;. These are cameras that were not normal retail items, but used for promotional purposes often by third-party companies to encourage customers to take advantage of their goods or services. This illastrates marketing genius on Kodak&#39;s part. A third-party company benefits by selling their own product, the customer gets a free camera, and Kodak gains a new customer that will buy their film and process it!\n\nCAUTION:\nRisk of Electric Shock and Fire Hazard.\nThis is not a toy and is not intended for use by children. For adult use only.\nFor safe use, plug only into exposed wall outlets where a device is ventilated and cannot contact bed coverings or other material.\nDo not use with extension cords.\n\nAre you looking for one with more &quot;features&quot;?\nCheck out my USB Charger Nightlight\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/127754660/usb-charger-nightlight-upcycled-vintage\nor one with a color changing LED\nhttps://www.etsy.com/listing/124491857/vintage-camera-led-night-light-kodak",

        "description": "This order is for 12 absolutely adorable cupcake or cookie toppers. They measure approximately 2 1/2- 3 inches and can be color customized. Just add a message in the notes to seller section during purchase. They are completely edible and taste wonderful. I make my own fondant so it tastes much better than store bought. \r\n\r\nJust slap these suckers on a cupcake or sugar cookie and you will be the hit of your next shindig!! \r\n\r\nThese fondant toppers are made to order after payment is received. I prefer to ship items closer to your event date in order to maintain freshness. Please provide the date of your event along with your purchase in the notes to seller section. If you need something rushed, please convo me and I will see what I can do!\r\n\r\nEach item is individually wrapped and packaged to allow for stress-free shipping. \r\n\r\nFondant toppers are edible for up to one year from date received.\r\n\r\nToppers should never be refrigerated or frozen. They store well in a plastic container (tupperware). Just move them to a cool dry area away from heat and light.\r\n\r\nI LOVE custom orders and would enjoy working with you to create the perfect little addition to you next party. \r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are in the Utah County area, I would love to bake up some delicious cupcakes or cookies for you next party. Convo me for details.\r\n\r\nThanks for checking me out",

You can also contact us directly.\r\n\r\nAre all your products home-made?\r\nWe use a combination of home-made pieces and specially selected products to make our party favors, gifts, and craft kits one-of-a-kind.\r\n\r\nWhere do you get all your ideas?\r\nYears of teaching, scouting, and parenting!\r\n\r\nI like a product, but I would like to make some changes?  Is that possible?\r\nYes! Just use the &quot;Request a Custom Order&quot; button on the shop homepage to let us know what you have in mind.  You can also contact us directly.\r\n\r\nWhat is the recommended age range for your craft kits?\r\nMost of our kits are suitable for kids age 5 to 105.  However, it is best to base your ordering on the skill and maturity level of your child or group of children.  Some projects may be frustrating for little hands, and some may require additional adult helpers.  Always keep small pieces away from children under 5 years of age to prevent accidental choking.\r\n\r\nWhat is the recommended age range for your party favors?\r\nOur party favors are suitable for kids age 5 to 105.  As much as possible, we try to include products with lasting appeal for all members of a group or family.\r\n\r\nDo you sell additional supplies that are needed to complete your craft kits?\r\nWe don&#39;t include some supplies (like scissors and glue) with our craft kit orders because many people already have these supplies on hand.  We don&#39;t want our customers to be forced to purchase supplies they already have.  If there is something you need, please contact us. We&#39;ll see what we can do!\r\n\r\nWhat are SWAPs?\r\nSWAPs are crafts, usually handmade, that are swapped between Girl Scouts.  The acronym, SWAPs, stands for “Something With A Pin” or “Special Whatchamacallits Affectionately Pinned Somewhere.”  The best SWAPs are girl-made and come with a message tag that identifies the Scouting event, troop, girl, or purpose of the SWAP.  SWAPs should also include a safety pin or pin-back.  Girl Scouts pin SWAPs on hats or hand-crafted SWAP holders.\r\n\r\nAre SWAPs just for Girl Scouts?\r\nNo way!  SWAPs are just crafts with a pin. Anyone can SWAP!\r\n",

Through this project I hope to answer and explore questions of family displacement, identity and disappointment. I plan to center the project around the sharp juxtaposition between who our families set us up to be and who we&#39;ve chosen to be.\r\nAt the end of this project I hope to close the Upstate NY chapter of my life. I feel it is only with a clear picture of our version of our past that we are able to move forward. As I try to rid myself of this history and things, I hope others can re-appropriate items, themes or images in a way that can give these things a new purpose and change the trajectory of our past&#39;s influence over who we are.
